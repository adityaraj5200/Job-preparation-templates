Email subject: Application for Software Engineer Job opportunities | Ex-Amazon SDE | Immediate Joiner | Aditya Raj


Hi Junaid,

I am writing to express my interest in possible software engineer job opportunities available at your organisation.

I am currently between roles so I am an immediate joiner, and I have 1.3 years of experience as an SDE at Amazon, where I worked primarily on Java backend development, building RESTful APIs and contributing to the design of scalable, high-performance systems. My technical skill set includes Java, Spring MVC, Spring Boot, Data Structures & Algorithms, Object oriented programming, etc.

Please find my resume attached for your reference. I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your engineering team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Aditya Raj
