# Fin-tech companies

Here’s an extended list of ~30 fintech / lending-focused companies in India that you should consider for job applications. I’ve grouped them roughly by size/maturity for ease. **Note:** I couldn’t find reliable public compensation data for all; you’ll need to ask during interviews.

### How you can use this list

* Visit each company’s **Careers or Job** page to check roles in tech (software, data), product, risk/underwriting, operations, analytics.
* For your background (Java backend, RESTful APIs, scalable systems), target roles like **backend engineer**, **platform engineer**, **data engineer**, **credit risk tech**, **lending platform microservices**.
* During applications, highlight your previous experience (1.4 yrs at Amazon) in building scalable services + your interest in fintech/credit systems to stand out.
* Ask about compensation broadly: base salary, bonuses, ESOP/stock (especially fintechs tend to give equity).
* Since you’re actively job-seeking, prioritize roles with “mid level” relevant to your experience (1-2 yrs), rather than senior too quickly.

If you like, I can **fetch current live job openings** for each of these (in one or two tables) and also **estimate typical compensation ranges** for your level (~1–2 years experience) in fintech lending in India (using available market data). Would you like me to pull that?
