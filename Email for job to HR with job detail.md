Hi Shilpi,

I hope you’re doing well. My name is Aditya Raj, and I came across the Software Engineer, Backend position on your company’s careers portal. The role aligns closely with my background and experience in Java,Spring,backend development and I wishes to give interview for this job.

I’ve previously worked at Amazon for 1 year 3 months and got laid off in May 2025. I’m confident that the my skills and perspective I bring from that experience would allow me to become a valuable hire in your organisation. I just need one opportunity to prove it in interviews. Could you please consider me for role?

I’ve attached my resume for your review. I would truly appreciate the opportunity to interview for this position.
