Hi, I’m a former Amazon SDE (B.Tech, NIT Agartala) impacted by the May layoffs, and really need a new job right now. I’m interested in this role (https://www.spotnana.com/careers/careers-listing/careers-listing-detail/?gh_jid=5363552004) and would really appreciate a referral. Can we connect so that I share my resume?
