Application for Software Engineer Job opportunities | Ex-Amazon SDE  | Immediate Joiner | Aditya Raj


Hi __company_name__ hiring team,

I am writing to express my interest in possible software engineer job opportunities available at your organisation.

I am currently between roles, so I am an immediate joiner, and I have 1year 3months of experience as a software engineer, my last employer being Amazon, where I got laid off in May 2025. My technical skill set includes Java, Spring MVC, Spring Boot, Microservices, RESTful APIs ,Data Structures & Algorithms, Object oriented programming, etc.

I’m confident that the my skills and perspective I bring from the previous experience would allow me to become a valuable hire in your organisation. I just need one opportunity to prove it in interviews. Could you please consider me for any vacant role?

Looking forward to hear from you.

Best regards,
Aditya Raj
